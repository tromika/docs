Documentation regarding how reputation works on Cantina

## Reputation score

The reputation score measures a researcher's contributions based on the quality and outcome of their submissions. It ranges from **0 to 100 points** and reflects reliability and expertise.\
All new users start with a baseline of **50 points**.\
Points are added or subtracted according to the rules below.

## Benefits of a high reputation score

This score represents a high signal to clients that indicates said individual's performance and track record across all Cantina competitions.

Having a high reputation score above or equal to **80** allows the researcher to submit issues without requiring POCs, as these individuals have proven to be more likely to submit valid findings.

## How can I improve my reputation score?

Through participating and submitting high-quality valid findings and following the scoring metrics listed below:

### Scoring Rules for Reputations

#### Confirmed Findings <a href="#confirmed-findings" id="confirmed-findings"></a>

Points are **added** for confirmed findings based on severity:

* **Critical/High Severity**: **+5 points**
* **Medium Severity**: **+3 points**
* **Low/Informational/Gas Severity**: **+1 point**

#### Negative Outcomes <a href="#negative-outcomes" id="negative-outcomes"></a>

Points are **subtracted** for the following:

* **Spam Findings**: **–5 points**
* **Rejected Findings**: **–3 points**
* **Rejected Escalations**: TBD

**Submission Quality Multiplier**

Each submission is evaluated for quality, which acts as a multiplier on points gained or lost:

Low: **–10%** of points \
Medium: No change (**baseline**) \
High: **+20%** of points

#### Duplication Scaling:

* If a finding has more than 8 duplicates then reputation score will not be awarded for the finding and its duplicates. &#x20;

## Examples <a href="#examples" id="examples"></a>

#### Example 1: Confirmed High Severity Finding with High Quality <a href="#example-1-confirmed-high-severity-finding-with-level-3-quality" id="example-1-confirmed-high-severity-finding-with-level-3-quality"></a>

* **Base Points**: +5 (for confirmed high severity)
* **Quality Multiplier**: +20% (High Quality)

**Calculation**:

* Quality Bonus: 5 points × 20% = **+1 point**
* Total Points Gained: 5 + 1 = **+6 points**

**Updated Reputation Score**:

* Starting Score: 50
* New Score: 50 + 6 = **56 points**

#### Example 2: Rejected Finding with Low Quality <a href="#example-2-rejected-finding-with-level-1-quality" id="example-2-rejected-finding-with-level-1-quality"></a>

* **Base Points**: –3 (for rejected finding)
* **Quality Multiplier**: –10% (Low Quality)

**Calculation**:

* Quality Penalty: abs(-3 points) x (-10%) = -0.3 points&#x20;
* Total points lost: -3 - 0.3 = -3.3

**Updated Reputation Score**:

* Starting Score: 50
* New Score: 50 – 3.3 = **46.7 points**

#### Example 3: Spam Finding <a href="#example-3-spam-finding" id="example-3-spam-finding"></a>

* **Base Points**: –5 (for spam finding)
* **Quality Multiplier**: Not applicable

**Updated Reputation Score**:

* Starting Score: 50
* New Score: 50 – 5 = **45 points**

#### Example 4: Rejected Escalation <a href="#example-4-rejected-escalation" id="example-4-rejected-escalation"></a>

* **Base Points**: –3 (for rejected escalation)
* **Quality Multiplier**: Not specified, assume baseline

**Updated Reputation Score**:

* Starting Score: 50
* New Score: 50 – 3 = **47 points**
