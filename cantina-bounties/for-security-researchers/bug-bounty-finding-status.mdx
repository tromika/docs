# 🔶 Bug Bounty Finding status

Below you can find a list with all the finding statuses used for bug bounty programs.

| Finding Status | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New            | Once a finding is submitted by the security researcher, it will be labelled as new by default.                                                                                                              |
| In Review      | The finding has been triaged and is currently being evaluated, either by the triage team or in collaboration with the client, to determine its validity and next steps.                                     |
| Rejected       | Upon review, if the finding does not meet the criteria or is deemed invalid, the triager or client will mark it as rejected.                                                                                |
| Duplicate      | A finding is marked as duplicate when it's the same issue reported by someone else. Duplicates are not rewarded in Bug Bounty programs.                                                                     |
| Confirmed      | When the finding is valid, it will be labelled as confirmed.                                                                                                                                                |
| Spam           | When a finding is marked as spam, it typically refers to the issue reported being irrelevant, low-quality, automated and inappropriate. Both the triagers and the client can mark this status for findings. |
| Withdrawn      | If the researcher submits an issue and decides to withdraw it for any reason, the finding will be labelled as "Withdrawn".                                                                                  |
| Disputed       | Researchers can use this status if you wish to challenge the initial decision and request mediation.                                                                                                        |
