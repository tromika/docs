# Bounty Severity Classification

### **Introduction**

At [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/solutions/bounties), we prioritize the security and integrity of our ecosystem. This **Severity Classification System** provides a standardized framework for evaluating and categorizing vulnerabilities based on their **impact** and **likelihood of exploitation**. This system is designed to ensure consistency and transparency in assessing risks across our programs.\
\
\
**Note:** This bounty severity classification serves as a general guide and may be customized based on individual client requirements. Some bug bounty programs may define their own severity criteria, so please review the respective program's home page carefully

***

### **Severity Levels**

We classify vulnerabilities in **four distinct levels** based on their **impact** and **likelihood of exploitation**. The severity of a vulnerability is determined by combining these two factors using the **Risk Classification Matrix** below:

| **Severity Level**     | **Impact: Critical** | **Impact: High** | **Impact: Medium** | **Impact: Low** |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical             | High             | Medium             | Low             |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High                 | High             | Medium             | Low             |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium               | Medium           | Low                | Informational   |

***

#### **1. Critical**

* **Impact**: Catastrophic damage to the protocol or its users.
  * Examples include severe loss of **assets**, permanent system disruption, or widespread compromise.
* **Likelihood**: High, with minimal or no user interaction required.
  * Exploitation is very easy or highly incentivized.
* **Examples**:
  * Permanent loss or freezing of **assets**.
  * Network-wide shutdown or inability to confirm transactions.
  * Unintended permanent chain splits requiring a hard fork.
  * Protocol insolvency or governance manipulation leading to direct financial harm.
  * **Web2**: Account takeover with significant impact (e.g., admin account compromise).

***

#### **2. High**

* **Impact**: Significant damage to the protocol or its users, but not catastrophic.
  * Examples include notable financial loss or significant harm to user trust.
* **Likelihood**: Medium to high, with some user interaction or specific conditions required.
  * Exploitation is possible under certain conditions.
* **Examples**:
  * Temporary freezing of **assets** or transactions.
  * Unintended chain splits (network partitions).
  * Theft of unclaimed yield or royalties.
  * Exploits requiring elevated privileges but with high impact.
  * **Web2**: Account takeover with moderate impact (e.g., user account compromise).

***

#### **3. Medium**

* **Impact**: Moderate damage, often limited to specific users or conditions.
  * Examples include limited financial damage or moderate system impact.
* **Likelihood**: Medium, requiring specific conditions or user interaction.
  * Exploitation is possible but not trivial.
* **Examples**:
  * Increased resource consumption or temporary disruption of network nodes.
  * Theft of gas or griefing attacks with no direct profit motive.
  * Bugs causing unintended smart contract behavior without direct financial risk.
  * **Web2**: Non-sensitive data disclosure, open redirects, or reflected HTML injection.

***

#### **4. Low**

* **Impact**: Minor damage, often limited to non-critical functionality.
  * Examples include minimal direct risk or areas for improvement.
* **Likelihood**: Low, requiring significant user interaction or unlikely conditions.
  * Exploitation is difficult or requires highly specific conditions.
* **Examples**:
  * Shutdown of a small percentage of network nodes without network-wide impact.
  * Modification of transaction fees outside design parameters.
  * Non-critical UI/UX issues or minor information disclosure.
  * **Web2**: Minor UI/UX issues or non-critical functionality disruptions.

***

### **Scope and Considerations**

#### **Blockchain**

* **Critical**: Network-wide issues, permanent **asset** loss, or hard fork requirements.
* **High**: Temporary network disruptions or unintended chain splits.
* **Medium**: Resource consumption spikes or localized node shutdowns.
* **Low**: Minor node disruptions or fee modifications.

#### **Smart Contracts**

* **Critical**: Direct theft, permanent freezing of **assets**, or governance manipulation.
* **High**: Theft of unclaimed yield, temporary freezing of **assets**, or unauthorized minting.
* **Medium**: Griefing, gas theft, or unbounded gas consumption.
* **Low**: Non-critical contract behavior or minor functionality issues.

#### **Websites and Apps**

* **Critical**: Remote code execution, unauthorized access to sensitive data, or significant financial harm.
* **High**: Sensitive data disclosure, subdomain takeovers (case-by-case basis), or unauthorized actions.
* **Medium**: Non-sensitive data disclosure, open redirects, or reflected HTML injection.
* **Low**: Minor UI/UX issues or non-critical functionality disruptions.

### **Out of Scope**

The following are considered out of scope for our vulnerability classification system:

* **Theoretical vulnerabilities** without proof of concept.
* **Social engineering attacks** or phishing.
* **Issues requiring physical access** to a user's device or local network.
* **Best practice recommendations** or feature requests.
* **Third-party integrations** or dependencies not under our control.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks** without demonstrated impact.
* **Self-XSS** or non-exploitable UI/UX issues.
* **Clickjacking** on pages with no sensitive actions.
* **Server Information & Status Pages** (e.g., stack traces, descriptive error messages).
* **SSL/TLS best practices** (e.g., missing SSL Pinning, insecure configurations).
* **Optional email security features** (e.g., SPF/DKIM/DMARC configurations).
* **Most issues related to rate limiting**.
* **Content-Security-Policy configuration opinions**.
* **Verbose error messages** without proof of exploitability.
* **Attacks requiring MITM or physical access** to a user's device.
* **Reports from automated tools or scans**.
* **Missing HTTP Only flags on non-sensitive cookies**.
* **Content spoofing, text injection**.
* **Issues without clearly identified security impact**.
* **Self-exploitation** (e.g., self-XSS, self-DoS, cookie reuse).
* **Tabnabbing**.
* **Brute forcing account credentials**.
* **Known vulnerable libraries** without a working Proof of Concept.
* **Open access to publicly-exposed resources** (e.g., Google Sheets) without demonstration of vulnerability exploitation.

***

### **Testing Guidelines**

To ensure safe and responsible testing:

* Use **local forks** for testing instead of public chains.
* Avoid actions that could disrupt network availability or integrity.
* Do not attempt to access, modify, or destroy data that does not belong to you.
* Submit detailed reports with **proof of concept** and steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

***

### **Eligibility**

To qualify for consideration:

* Report a **previously unknown, non-public vulnerability** within the program's scope.
* Be the **first to disclose** the vulnerability.
* Provide sufficient information for our team to reproduce and resolve the issue.
* Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or making it public.
* Comply with all program rules and guidelines.

***

### **Prohibited Actions**

The following actions are strictly prohibited:

* Testing on **public mainnet or testnet deployments**.
* Public disclosure of vulnerabilities without prior consent.
* Engaging in **illegal activities** or coercive tactics.
* Exploiting vulnerabilities for personal gain.
