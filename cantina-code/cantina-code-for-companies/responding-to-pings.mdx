# 🗄️ Responding to Pings

When a Security Researcher pings you using the `@project`  tag, a notification will be displayed on the [company-dashboard.md](../../cantina-account/company-account/company-dashboard.md "mention")and also sent via email.

{% hint style="info" %}
You are encouraged to regularly check for notifications in order to respond promptly to Security Researcher questions, which may lead to the discovery of a vulnerability.
{% endhint %}

**Pings can be either unlimited or limited depending the type of engagement**.&#x20;

This is a featured linked to the Cantina [reputation.md](../../reputation.md "mention") mechanism to encourage Security Researchers to ask good questions to not waste your time. For example, **pings are limited** during [competitions.md](../../services/competitions.md "mention") in order to shield you from low quality pings.&#x20;

If you find a question or comment useful, you can give the ping back to the Security Researcher by hovering over `@project`. On the other hand, **during a Security Review pings are unlimited** because the engagement is constrained to a small number of participants.
