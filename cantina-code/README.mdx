# 💻 Cantina Code

Cantina Code is a code review platform specifically developed to conduct security reviews of any kind. It provides a convenient interface which enables users to perform [code-review](cantina-code-for-security-researchers/code-review/ "mention")s, [chat.md](cantina-code-for-security-researchers/chat.md "mention") with relevant parties and submit [findings](cantina-code-for-security-researchers/findings/ "mention").

{% hint style="info" %}
Cantina Code is mostly available for [cantina-competitions](../cantina-competitions/ "mention") and gradually opening to support other services.
{% endhint %}

Depending on which side you are on (a Client, Guild or Security Researcher) your interaction flow with the interface will change.

If you are a **Client** receiving security services, use the link below

* [cantina-code-for-companies](cantina-code-for-companies/ "mention")&#x20;

or if you are a **Security Researcher** offering security services, click the following link:
