# 🔶 Code Review

## **Code Review**

The Code Review section is split into two main areas.

* **On the left, the navigation panel** to search and scroll across the repository for all relevant files in scope.
* &#x20;**On the right, the visual output** of the file selection made on the left-hand side.

<Note>
Soon it will be possible to show in-scope and out-of-scope files and folders.
