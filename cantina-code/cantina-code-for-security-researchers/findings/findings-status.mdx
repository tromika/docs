# 🔸 Findings Status

Statuses represent the state of a finding. The importance of each status is dependent on the type of security review and by the Cantina Repository administrator priorities. The image below represents a finding with a Confirmed status.

The most standardized statuses are the following:

| Finding Status | Explanation                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New            | Once a finding is submitted by the security researcher, it will be labelled as new by default.                                   |
| Confirmed      | When the finding is valid, it will be labelled as confirmed and be awarded based on the competition prize pool.                  |
| Acknowledged   | After a finding is confirmed by the judge, the competition sponsor will have to acknowledge and double confirm the issue.        |
| Fixed          | The sponsor after acknowledging issues can apply fixes to the code. This label is used for bookkeeping of issues already fixed.  |
| Withdrawn      | If the researcher submits an issue and decides to withdraw it for any reason, the finding will be labelled as "Withdrawn".       |
