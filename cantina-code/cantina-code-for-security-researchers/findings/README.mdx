# 🔶 Findings

The identification of a system bug, security vulnerability or a "**Finding**", is a documented instance of a potential security threat identified within a software system or application. This typically includes details such as the nature of the vulnerability, its location in the code base, the potential impact on system integrity and recommended remediation.

The **Findings** **section** in the Cantina Code Repository provides a convenient way to interact with findings by allowing the security researcher to:

* Navigate, sort, label and comment on findings.
* Submit, edit, and withdraw a finding.
