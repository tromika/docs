# 🔶 Diagrams & Formulas

Cantina Code supports **diagramming** libraries such as [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) and **MathJax for** mathematical formula rendering. Paired with a well written finding or comment, these tools allow you to visually and efficiently communicate your point to the reader.

## Mermaid Diagram

The following code block

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Bank
    participant Attacker

    Attacker->>+Bank: Request withdrawal
    Bank->>+Attacker: Transfer funds
    Attacker->>+Bank: Request withdrawal (reentry)
    Bank->>+Attacker: Transfer funds (reentry)
    Bank-->>-Attacker: Insufficient balance
```

when introduced as a comment will display as illustrated in the image below.

## MathJax Formulas

Cantina Comments also render MathJax formulas. The following code block

```
$$
H_{f} = \frac {\sum Collateral_{i}\;in\;ETH  \times  Liquidation\;Threshold}{Total\;Collateral\;in\;ETH} 
$$
```

when introduced inside a comment will render as such
