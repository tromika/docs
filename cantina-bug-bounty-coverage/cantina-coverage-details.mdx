### **Coverage Conditions**

* In addition to the having sufficient score to be eligible

#### **Mandatory Fix Review:**

* All competitions must undergo a comprehensive fix review.
* Coverage: Ratio of fixed findings to total findings should be more than 90%
* If fixes from the competition introduce new logic, an additional review of this logic is required. Protocol eligibility and coverage amount will only be reassessed after this additional logic review is completed successfully.
* Also, if a separate comprehensive review/competition is prescribed then it must be completed to be eligible.

#### Scope:

* Only the code at the specified commit hash, and the files that were in scope for the Spearbit/Cantina review and competition, are eligible for coverage.
* Any further change in the code that was not reviewed by Spearbit/Cantina as a part of the competition or the fix review that may result in a bug would not be eligible for the bounty

#### Vulnerabilities:

* The coverage applies to only Critical severity bugs as defined on the respective bounty homepage or cantina [docs](https://docs.cantina.xyz/cantina-docs/cantina-bounties/bounty-severity-classification)
* Cantina Triaging team has the final say on the severity of the submission.

### **Example Calculations:**

#### **Example 1:** Ideal Scenario

* Findings: 0 High, 0 Medium (Total Penalty: 0 points)
* Timeline adhered to: No penalty
* Spearbit review: 1.2x
* Large Pot multiplier: 1.3x
* Multiple security measures: +10 points

**Calculation:**

* Adjusted Score: (100 + 10) = 110 points
* Multipliers: 110 x 1.2 x 1.3 = 171.6 points (capped at 100 points)
* Final Coverage: **$300,000**

#### **Example 2:** Multiple Medium Findings

* Findings: 0 High, 9 Medium (Total Penalty: 45 points)
* Timeline adhered to: No penalty
* Spearbit review: 1.2x
* Large Pot multiplier: 1.3x
* Multiple security measures: +10 points

**Calculation:**

* Adjusted Score: (100 - 45 + 10) = 65 points
* Multipliers: 65 x 1.2 x 1.3 = 101.4 points (capped at 100 points)
* Final Coverage: **$300,000**

#### **Example 3:** Lower Scenario

* Findings: 3 High, 4 Medium (Total Penalty: 50 points)
* Timeline reduced: -10 points
* Cantina review: 1.0x
* Smaller Pot multiplier: 0.8x
* Single security measure: +0 points

**Calculation:**

* Adjusted Score: (100 - 50 - 10) = 40 points
* Multipliers: 40 x 1.0 x 0.8 = 32 points
* Final Coverage: **Not Eligible (below 50 points)**
