# 📜 Judging Phase

## Judge Responsibilities

During this phase, judges are responsible of handling different operation for findings.&#x20;

These are extended and not limited to managing thorough duplication of all raised issues, which helps in identifying and filtering out obvious low or invalid concerns.

They are tasked with evaluating issues based on established rules and may seek feedback from sponsors when necessary to make informed judgments. Furthermore, judges facilitate a system of escalation, allowing researchers to present additional information for reevaluation of their issues. In such scenarios, judges provide valuable feedback, incorporating the sponsor's perspective if needed.&#x20;

Ultimately, while judges contribute significantly to the reassessment process, the final decision often resides with the Cantina internal team, ensuring that all judgments are well-considered and equitable.
