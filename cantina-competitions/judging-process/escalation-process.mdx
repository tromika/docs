# 📜 Escalation Process

## Overview

After the judging phase, the escalation process starts. If a finding was judged and the security researcher that submitted the issue doesn't agree with the severity given, they can appeal for an escalation process and provide extra information justifying the appeal.

**Each security researcher can only escalate issues submitted by themselves, and if invalid, will be penalized $100 from their future credit of potential earnings from the competition.**

Here's a tutorial on how to initiate an escalation on your finding:

## How does the Escalation process work in Cantina?

Within Cantina, researchers can only escalate their own findings during the escalation phase. This is done to avoid unnecessary escalations

* Researchers can only escalate their own findings
* A penalty of $100 is applied on invalid escalations
* Cantina will have the final say in escalations

### Private Comments on Findings

* On the platform, you can now add comments to any findings. These comments will remain hidden from everyone except the judges.
* Your comments can help judges make an informed decision on a finding or reassess a finding after an escalation.
* Please be mindful when commenting on other's findings. Keep your comments objective and specific to the finding.
