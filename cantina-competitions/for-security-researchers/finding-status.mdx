Below you can find a list with all the finding statuses used during a competition.

| Finding Status | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New            | Once a finding is submitted by the security researcher, it will be labelled as new by default.                                                                                                            |
| Rejected       | Upon review, if the finding does not fit the criteria within the competitive scoring schema, the judge will list the finding as rejected.                                                                 |
| Duplicate      | A finding is marked as duplicate when it's the same issue reported by someone else. Duplicates are rewarded as well.                                                                                      |
| Confirmed      | When the finding is valid, it will be labelled as confirmed and be awarded based on the competition prize pool.                                                                                           |
| Spam           | When a finding is marked as spam, it typically refers to the issue reported being irrelevant, low-quality, automated and inappropriate. Both the judge and the sponsor can mark this status for findings. |
| Withdrawn      | If the researcher submits an issue and decides to withdraw it for any reason, the finding will be labelled as "Withdrawn".                                                                                |
