# 🔶 Teams

In Cantina, security researchers are able to form teams with other researchers to participate in competitions. To register as a team, refer to [this section](https://discord.com/channels/1164178130425098290/1200562236679274668) in our Discord[.](https://discord.com/channels/1164178130425098290/1200562236679274668)

Within a team, you can read comments left by your teammates on a code base as well as view, edit and escalate their findings, allowing for efficient collaboration during competitions.

## Team Payments💰&#x20;

As of now team payments are disbursed to the team leaders, and it's up to the team leader to distribute responsibly. Cantina will **not** be responsible for any internal feuds within teammates.

## Team Creation

In order to apply as a team, within the Cantina discord team-submissions chat, send in the team submission request as the following format:

<pre><code>Team Submission Request
- Team Name:
- Competition Name:
<strong>- Team Lead (Cantina Username): 
</strong>- Other Team Members (Cantina Usernames):
</code></pre>

When the Cantina core team has processed the application, you will see the team name you are part of on the top right section within the competition repository.

Team applications are **only effective for the mentioned competition.** If you want to participate in a different competition with the same team, send another team application request.&#x20;

Please refrain from making findings before the team is made, as once a finding is submitted, teaming up is no longer possible.
