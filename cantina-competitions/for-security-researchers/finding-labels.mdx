| Escalated | The "Escalated" status is designated for findings that have been escalated due to a disagreement between the researcher and the judge during the judging phase. This status is exclusively applied during the escalation phase of the process. After the judging phase when the escalation phase starts, if a researcher disagrees with the decision made by the judge regarding their finding, they have the option to escalate it. This status serves as a mean to address such disagreements and ensure fair resolution. For further details on the escalation process and its guidelines, please refer to the [escalation-process.md](../judging-process/escalation-process.md "mention"). |
