# 🤝 Fellowship Steward Model

#### **1. Researcher Responsibilities**

* **Competition participation**: Researchers must dedicate their full and best efforts to the assigned competition.
* **Fix Review**: Researchers are required to conduct one (1) day of fix review for each full week that the competition runs (e.g., a three-week competition requires three days of fix review), up to a maximum of four (4) days. The exact duration will be determined before the competition begins.
* **Leaderboard Performance**: Researchers are expected to perform well on the leaderboard (top x% based on competition size).
* **Judging Assistance**: Researchers may assist in judging submissions if required.

***

#### **2. Payment Structure**

Researchers earn a percentage of the prize pot based on the size of the pot and their performance. The payment structure is tiered as follows:

| **Prize Pot Size** | **Researcher Share (Approx)**                         | **Performance Requirement** |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **$500k+**         | Standard Weekly rates capped at 20% of the public pot | Top 25% of LB               |
| **$100k - $500k**  | 10-15% of pot                                         | Top 40% of LB               |
| **< $100k**        | Up to 40% of pot                                      | Top 60% of LB               |

**Final Discretion:** All payments are subject to Cantina’s assessment. While this framework ensures fairness, adjustments may be made to reflect a researcher’s impact, competition complexity, or other valuable contributions.

***

#### **3. Penalties for Underperformance**

To ensure accountability, penalties are imposed if researchers fail to meet expectations:

* **Leaderboard penalties**: Payment is reduced by 20% for every 10% below the required percentile, subject to a floor: no payment will be issued if the researcher falls below the 70th percentile.
* **Fix Review Failure**: If a researcher fails to complete the fix review, their payment is withheld until the issues are resolved.
* **Lost Opportunity:** If a researcher incurs penalties in more than three competitions, they will be temporarily barred from future dedicated researcher engagements until the Cantina team reviews their performance.

#### **4. Minimum Findings Threshold**

* All payment/penalty terms apply **only if the competition has > 3 total H/M findings**.
* If **total findings is ≤ 3**, Cantina evaluates performance case-by-case.

***

#### **5. Example Scenario**

* **Prize Pot**: $300k
* **Researcher Share**: 12% of pot = $36,000
* **Researcher Ranking**: Top 40% of leaderboard
* **Total Payment**: $36,000 (prize share)

If the researcher fails to meet the top 40% leaderboard requirement, their prize share is reduced by 20% for every 10% drop below the requirement. Ex. _Top 50%: $36,000 → $28,800._

***

#### **6. Additional Notes**

* **Mandatory Participation**: Researchers must commit to the full duration of the competition and fulfill all responsibilities to receive payment.
* If a Fellowship Steward is assigned to a competition and meets both of the program’s conditions, they will receive whichever amount is higher: the fellowship bonus or the fixed pool allocation.
* Cantina reserves the right to change the above rules and review on case by cases basis
