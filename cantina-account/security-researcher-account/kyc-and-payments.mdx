# 🔹 KYC and Payments

## Know Your Customer

To receive payments you must first undergo the Know Your Customer process. This process is conducted using [withpersona.com](https://withpersona.com/). Cantina does not store any personal user information.

After the identity verification process is complete, you will be able to set up your address and receive payments.

## Add payment address
