# 💵 Referral program

Cantina's referral program offers industry-leading incentives for individuals that refer projects to Cantina. At Cantina, we recognize the high value placed on trust within the Web3 industry, and we're committed to rewarding those who contribute to our growth appropriately. Financial incentives provided to individuals under this program are broken out into two categories: Client Referrals and Bug Bounty Referrals. We will cover both below.

### Client Referrals

At Cantina, we believe in compensating you accordingly for your vouch of confidence in our platform to other projects within the Web3 industry. \

**Individuals that refer a client for any type of engagement outside of a bug bounty will receive 5% of the deal size.**&#x20;

### Bug Bounty Referrals

With Bug Bounty Referrals, individuals who provide referrals are compensated when the first payout is made as part of the bounty program on Cantina.

**For the first valid bug bounty finding, 100% of Cantina's program fee will be given to the individual who referred the client hosting the bounty.**

### Referral Submission

In order to qualify for a referral, please make an introduction to the referral point of contact and any of the following communication channels:

Telegram: `@mleffer`

Email: `sales@spearbit.com`

Discord: `@mikespearbit`

Below is an example copy of what a qualifying referral would look like: ”Hi team, I wanted to introduce John Smith, the founder of SpaceSwap, an innovative DeFi primitive focused on non-custodial lending. They are interested in running a competition with Cantina so I thought I'd warm up the introduction.”

### Conditions of Acceptance

* Bug Bounty Referrals: One Hundred Percent (100%) of Program Fee. For purposes herein, “Program Fee” means the gross revenues actually received by Cantina from any Eligible Referral pursuant to a Customer Agreement entered into in consideration for such Eligible Referral's participation in and hosting of a bug bounty program through the Services (“Bug Bounty Services”) at the point that the initial valid bug bounty has been found pursuant to the Bug Bounty Services, less third-party fees paid or payable and applicable transaction fees, such as credit card processing fees or similar fees, taxes, customs duties, import and export taxes and tariffs, collection fees and amounts paid or payable by Cantina as refunds or credits to any such Eligible Referral with respect to the Services previously provided.
* Competitions and Other Referrals: Five Percent (5%) of Net Referral Revenues.
