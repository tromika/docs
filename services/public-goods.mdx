# Public Goods

Cantina provides a platform for public goods (i.e. open source projects with no financial incentive structure in place) to receive security reviews. **Cantina does not take a network fee for these engagements**.

An example is the [Solady security review](https://cantina.xyz/crowdfund/solady), **where $99,000 were successfully collected through a public fundraising effort** to enable a team of security researchers scrutinize the [Solady ](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady)public library for vulnerabilities. The report is available in the following link: [Solady Report](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/018cf146-6e36-49a9-82b3-9ae39904f95a).

Security reviews for public goods like open-source projects are essential. They ensure these vital resources are safe and reliable for global use, thus supporting a secure digital ecosystem.&#x20;
