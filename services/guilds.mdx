# Guilds

Cantina Guilds offer a bespoke security review experience. Each guild, including [Spearbit](https://cantina.xyz/guilds/spearbit), has its own set of standards to ensure quality. Cantina Guilds enable clients to access niche security talent for OPSEC reviews, penetration testing, curated fuzzing, Cosmos and Solana expertise, and more.

For services provided by a guild, the logo of that specific guild will appear on the report, lending their own reputation and credibility. Guilds also have the liberty to set their own pricing, which will vary from guild to guild.

## Spearbit

Spearbit is a decentralized network of security experts. We provide security consulting services to clients in web3.

Unlike traditional auditing firms which employ teams of full-time security researchers, Spearbit sources top talent from everywhere in the web3 ecosystem to assemble the best possible team for the job.

We also invest heavily into mentoring new security researchers, who get the opportunity to work alongside and learn from some of the most prominent names in the industry.

For our security researchers, we provide the operational layer to ensure that none of their valuable time is wasted on menial administrative work or client sourcing and due diligence. We also give them the opportunity to regularly collaborate with other security researchers instead of working alone.
